= Default Views (default)

scaffolding-like default views for resourceful views. Also assumes you are using InheritedResources.
	
For Example, in your controller you might put:

	resourceful_views DefaultViewsDefault
	
Or use the defaults as the fallback for your own customizations

	resourceful_views :my_view_customizations, DefaultViewsDefault
